# Thera-Bank
## In assignment1.py, I built 3 models.
## In test.py, I tested these 3 models and picked the one with highest accuracy up as final_pipeline.
## Then used pipeline.pkl to predict data.
## Finally, I used streamlit to built a small web page to visualize the results and the whole analysis process in app.py. 
## In app.py, you just execute code: "streamlit run app.py", you would see the web page.
## Before run the above code, please meake sure that you have install streamlit package. If not, please run "pip install streamlit".
